This Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware plugin searches for Malware and other Virus like threats and vulnerabilities on your server and it helps you remove them.

== Description ==

It is almost impossible to detect every possible Malware threats, therefor this scanner may only find specific security threats and vulnerabilities that were know by me at the time of the latest release. Updated definition files can be downloaded within this plugin.

Updated Mar-27th 

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the plugin into your WordPress plugins directory (usually `/wp-content/plugins/`).
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress Admin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I automatically remove the "possible treats" in yellow? =

Many of these files may use eval and other powerful PHP function for perfectly legitimate reasons and removing that code from the files would likely cripple or even break your site so I have only enabled the Auto remove feature for "know threats".

== Screenshots ==

1. The menu showing Anti-Malware.
2. Aexample scan that found threats threats.
